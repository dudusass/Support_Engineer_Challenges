<hr>

## Challenge 2
<h3> I decided to start the algorithm by filtering what is letter and number, I used a regex method that I found on stackoverflow to check the entire alphabet. After that, I just needed to return the variables inside an array.
Then i used Math.max to find the Largest number but if you put an array with a 0 it will return an error Message.
After this, i used the functions to extract the values from array and put it inside a variable. Finishing it i just had to test it and worked fine.
